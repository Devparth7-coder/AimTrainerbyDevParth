Customization
Easy Modifications
You can easily customize the game by editing these variables in the code:

Game Duration (line ~25):

python
self.game_duration = 30  # Change to desired seconds
Target Size (line ~60):

python
self.radius = 30  # Initial target size
Difficulty Settings (lines ~110-115):

python
self.spawn_delay = 1.0  # Initial spawn delay
self.difficulty_interval = 5  # Seconds between difficulty increases
Color Scheme
Modify the color constants at the top of the file to change the visual theme:

python
BACKGROUND = (20, 20, 35)  # Dark blue
TARGET_COLOR = (220, 60, 60)  # Red
TEXT_COLOR = (240, 240, 240)  # White
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Game won't start:

Ensure Python is installed: python --version

Verify Pygame installation: pip list | grep pygame

Check file is named aim_trainer.py

Game runs slowly:

Close other applications to free up system resources

Reduce screen resolution if needed

Update graphics drivers

Targets not responding to clicks:

Check mouse is functioning properly

Ensure game window is active/focused

Verify no other applications are capturing mouse events

System Requirements
OS: Windows 7+, macOS 10.9+, or Linux

RAM: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended

Storage: 10MB free space

Display: 800√ó600 resolution minimum

Tips for Improvement
Focus on Accuracy - It's better to hit fewer targets accurately than to spam clicks

Use Your Peripheral Vision - Don't just watch your cursor, scan the entire screen

Practice Regularly - Short, frequent sessions are more effective than long ones

Stay Relaxed - Tension in your hand reduces precision

Find Your Rhythm - Develop a consistent clicking tempo
