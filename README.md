- üìä **Real-time Statistics** - Track your score, accuracy, and remaining time  
- üéÆ **Simple Controls** - Easy to learn, difficult to master  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timed Sessions** - 30-second rounds for quick practice sessions  
- üèÜ **Performance Metrics** - Detailed post-game statistics  
- üé® **Clean Interface** - Minimalist design that stays out of your way  
- üîÑ **Multiple Game States** - Menu, gameplay, and results screens  

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Step-by-Step Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the game files
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aim-trainer.git
cd aim-trainer

# Install Pygame
pip install pygame

# Run the game
python aim_trainer.py
````

### Alternative: Direct Download

1. Download `aim_trainer.py` from the repository
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the download directory
3. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
4. Run: `python aim_trainer.py`

## How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. Launch the game to see the main menu
2. Click **Start Game** to begin a 30-second session
3. Click on red targets as they appear on screen

### During Gameplay

* Targets appear randomly on the screen
* Click each target before it disappears
* Avoid clicking where there are no targets (counts as a miss)
* Watch the timer in the top-right corner

### Game Completion

* After 30 seconds, the game ends automatically
* View your final score and accuracy percentage
* Choose to play again or return to the main menu

## Game Mechanics

### Target Behavior

* **Appearance**: Red circles with concentric white rings
* **Spawning**: Random locations, avoiding screen edges
* **Lifetime**: 2 seconds initially, decreases with difficulty
* **Size**: Starts at 30px radius, shrinks to 15px minimum

### Difficulty Progression

* Every 5 seconds, the game increases in difficulty
* Targets spawn faster (down to 0.3 seconds between spawns)
* Targets become smaller (down to 15px radius)
* Target lifetime decreases (down to 1 second)

## Controls

| Action     | Control                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Start Game | Click "Start Game" button     |
| Aim        | Move mouse                    |
| Shoot      | Left mouse click              |
| Restart    | Click "Play Again" after game |
| Main Menu  | Click "Main Menu" after game  |
| Quit Game  | Close window or press Alt+F4  |

## Scoring

### Points System

* **Hit Target**: +1 point
* **Missed Click**: +0 points (counts against accuracy)
* **Expired Target**: +0 points (counts against accuracy)

### Accuracy Calculation

```
Accuracy = (Hits √∑ (Hits + Misses)) √ó 100%
```

### Performance Metrics

* **Novice**: 0‚Äì15 points
* **Intermediate**: 16‚Äì30 points
* **Advanced**: 31‚Äì45 points
* **Expert**: 46+ points

## Customization

### Easy Modifications

**Game Duration**

```python
self.game_duration = 30  # Change to desired seconds
```

**Target Size**

```python
self.radius = 30  # Initial target size
```

**Difficulty Settings**

```python
self.spawn_delay = 1.0  # Initial spawn delay
self.difficulty_interval = 5  # Seconds between difficulty increases
```

### Color Scheme

```python
BACKGROUND = (20, 20, 35)    # Dark blue
TARGET_COLOR = (220, 60, 60) # Red
TEXT_COLOR = (240, 240, 240) # White
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game won't start:**

* Ensure Python is installed: `python --version`
* Verify Pygame installation: `pip list | grep pygame`
* Check file is named `aim_trainer.py`

**Game runs slowly:**

* Close other applications to free up system resources
* Reduce screen resolution if needed
* Update graphics drivers

**Targets not responding to clicks:**

* Check mouse is functioning properly
* Ensure game window is active/focused
* Verify no other applications are capturing mouse events

### System Requirements

* **OS**: Windows 7+, macOS 10.9+, or Linux
* **RAM**: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended
* **Storage**: 10MB free space
* **Display**: 800√ó600 resolution minimum

## Tips for Improvement

1. **Focus on Accuracy** ‚Äì It's better to hit fewer targets accurately than to spam clicks
2. **Use Your Peripheral Vision** ‚Äì Don't just watch your cursor, scan the entire screen
3. **Practice Regularly** ‚Äì Short, frequent sessions are more effective than long ones
4. **Stay Relaxed** ‚Äì Tension in your hand reduces precision
5. **Find Your Rhythm** ‚Äì Develop a consistent clicking tempo

## Development

This game was developed using:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pygame** library
* Object-oriented programming principles

The code is structured with clear separation between game logic, rendering, and user interface components.
